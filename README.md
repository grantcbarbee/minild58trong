# minild58trong
This is the source code for my MiniLD58 Entry: Trong

I have been coding in C# for less than a year now, so I'm not sure how helpful this will even be, but if you learn anything from it or find any useful parts, feel free to use them in your own projects.

Really, the only thing that I ask is that if for some reason you decide to remake the game from the existing code, that you make it free and give people the option to see your source code as well.

If you have any kind of qestions you can shoot me an email at lizardsrcools@gmail.com
